# Navbar Transformation

## Overview
This update transforms the dashboard's sidebar navigation into a modern horizontal navbar similar to the Vercel design. The new navbar provides a cleaner interface while maintaining all the functionality of the previous sidebar.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a New Navbar Component**
   - Created `components/Dashboard/Navbar.tsx` with a horizontal navigation layout
   - Implemented responsive design with mobile menu support
   - Added user profile dropdown with settings and logout options
   - Added animated indicator bar that slides between active navigation items

2. **Updated Dashboard Layout**
   - Modified `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` to use the new navbar component
   - Improved the overall page structure for better content flow
   - Enhanced responsive behavior for different screen sizes

3. **Adjusted Dashboard Page**
   - Updated padding and container styles in `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
   - Added maximum width constraint for better readability on large screens

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens
- **User Profile Dropdown**: Easy access to user settings and logout
- **Mobile Menu**: Collapsible menu for small screens
- **Clean Interface**: Modern, minimal design similar to Vercel's UI
- **Animated Navigation Indicator**: Smooth sliding indicator bar that highlights the active page

## Usage

The navbar automatically displays the user's avatar (if available) or a fallback with their initial. Navigation links maintain the same destinations as the previous sidebar.

The active page is highlighted with a blue text color and an animated indicator bar that slides beneath the active link.

## Technical Implementation

- Uses React hooks for state management
- Implements Tailwind CSS for styling
- Maintains dark/light mode support
- Uses Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Preserves all existing functionality from the sidebar
